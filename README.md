# Moods

## Listen to whatever you're in the mood for; don't get stuck on the same playlist

Playlists are on the way out. Tired of listening to the same songs on the same playlists over and over again? Can't decide what playlist to add that song to?

### Enter Moods

Tag songs with whatever mood they make you feel. Create playlists on the fly by choosing the moods you wan't - and the moods you don't want.

Throwback to #rock #classics, but ignore #80s.

Roadtrip with #indie, but only those in #french and #spanish.

Party with #electronic music but no #EDM tonight.

## You will need a Spotify Premium account in order to use Moods

Enjoy :)
